**Revenue Sharing Model:**
We need to factor in various components while trying to come up with an algorithm to decide the revenue sharing.
For each user, we can calculate an "Engagement score" based on the number of likes, comments, and subscribers viewing their posts.
Also, we can track the revenue generated within a period of time (say, a month).
A portion of this amount goes to the platform, and the rest can be divided amongst the creators in proportion of their engagement score.
